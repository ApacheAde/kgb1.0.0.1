# TSC Structure and Governance

## Members

### Permanent members

Initially the TSC was formed with three permanent members appointed by the ZLC. To appoint a permanent member of the TSC requires a successful vote by the TSC on such an appointment. 

### Squad representatives

Each squad that is part of the Zowe project has its representative on the TSC. The squad votes on the representative on a yearly basis. The details of the vote is left to the squads.

### Removal from the TSC role

It’s possible to remove a person from the role on the TSC. To do so two-thirds vote of the entire TSC is required. If such person was appointed the squad, the squad needs to elect another representative on next squad meeting, if the person is permanent member then the person is removed from the document and loses voting rights. 

## Roles

The TSC has internally decided to create three roles focusing on different aspects of the governance of the Zowe. The roles are held by the TSC members and the members are voted into the roles. The [https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md) contains the currently appointed members with the function time frames. The time frame for helding the role is year. It’s possible for one person to hold all three roles. 


*   Zowe TAC Representative
    *   Person voting within TAC on behalf of Zowe. 
*   Zowe Ambassador
    *   Designated talking head of the Zowe, together with the ZLC which should help in this area
*   Zowe Chair (Zowe administrator)
    *   Leading the Zowe within, figuring out processes, helping with improvements, ombudsman for those who feel unjust. 


### Process

Two weeks before the time frame for the previous appointments ends, the TSC will held vote for the new ones. Any TSC member is eligible to be a candidate. The candidates will have a short time to present themselves and their vision during this voting meeting and afterwards the TSC will vote specific persons to each role. 


## Voting


### In the meeting

The meeting is happening in the chat of the Zoom call. The question and the options is outlined and specified in the call. All members with voting rights then vote for one of the outlined alternatives. The alternative is accepted if the quorum as defined in the TSC Charter was achieved and at least half of the quorum votes for one of the options. 


### Outside of the meeting

The quorum for voting outside of the meeting is defined in the TSC charter. The voting will be held in the zowe-tsc Slack channel. The question and possible answers will be outlined in the question posted by the Zowe Chair. The voting time frame is 24 hours and the voting members are expected to vote in the thread in the slack channel. The vote results will be captured and stored in the Community ([https://github.com/zowe/community/](https://github.com/zowe/community/)) repository.
