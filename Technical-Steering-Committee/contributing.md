This document explains roles within Zowe and the ways and requirements for contribution. 

# Roles

Anyone: (Github READ minus PR review, wiki editing)
- Can read code
- Can file issues
- Can create PRs
- Can comment on issues

Anyone can become a contributor upon request after doing one of the following:
- File an issue
- Create a PR


Contributor: (Github TRIAGE minus wiki editing)
- Everything "Anyone" can do plus
- Can review PRs
- Edit issues and PRs (labels, closing)
- Can submit blog posts for approval
- Can submit videos for approval

Contributors can become Committers via being voted into the role by Committers

Committers: (Github WRITE)
- Everything "Contributors" can do plus
- Can make branches
- Can create releases
- Can merge code
- Can delete unprotected branches
- Can approve blog posts
- Can approve videos
- Can update the website (the action of taking the latest branch and making it public, is this committer or admin?)
- Can edit wikis


Committers can become Administrators of a squad by being voted into the role by Committers

Administrators (Squad) (Github ADMIN):
- Everything "Contributors" can do plus
- Every action not already listed, such as but not limited to
- Adding and removing users to the roles
- Changing branch permissions
- Changing github hooks
- Changing repo status

## Removal from role

What should the Squad do when someone becomes inactive?

Example reasons for inactivity:

- Changes in life removing the possibility for the person to continue in the current role
- Changing company to another in which the person won't have the possibility to contribute
- Changing project within a company to another where the person won't be able to contribute
- Any other reason for stopping the contribution

We expect the person in any of the situations that will limit their ability to contribute in the roles Commiter and Administrator to let the members of the squad know either via the Slack channel or on the next squad meeting that such situation is arising.

The TSC will prepare general expectations towards the roles and the squads will adapt and complete the template provided by TSC with the specific squad-related requirements.

In case any person stops fulfilling the roles of the specific role without any reason such as mid-term illness, it is the right and requirement on the squad to remove the person from such position. The removal happens automatically without a vote and the squad is just acknowledging the situation. In case there is a conflict about the situation it is possible to escalate the matter to the TSC. 

## Misc

Votes: Must be cast in a public place, such as github, mailing list, or slack. A simple majority is recommended.

Record keeping: Roles (all, or only those related to github?) must be assigned via Github Teams (https://github.com/orgs/zowe/teams) to make it all visible in one place, and provide for simple assignment of github permissions by roles.

Global admins: They exist but are not codified currently. It includes people above the Zowe level, such as the OMP and LF. But, at the Zowe level, who would they be? Appointed by the TSC? TSC members themselves? Global admins exist to solve issues around security, visibility, and repo problems squad admins are having an issue with as they arise

Odd issues such as creation of the TSC: Now handled by the TSC, so no need to describe it in the roles document.
