# Contributing and roles

This document explains roles within Zowe and the ways and requirements for contribution. 

The goal of the document is to outline key roles within Zowe with the guidance for the squads around the privileges associated with the roles. Each squad can update the privileges as needed. The exact structure and rules if changed will be in the CONTRIBUTING.md in the repositories belonging to the squad. 

The roles will be reflected in Teams on the Zowe GitHub ([Github Teams](https://github.com/orgs/zowe/teams)). Each Squad will have a Committers, Contributors and Administrators teams.

### Zowe administrators

Selected by TSC. Needs to be voted to the position. The zowe wide administrator will have the Administrator privileges for all Zowe repositories. 

The Open Mainframe Project and Linux Foundation may also appoint people to these roles. Procedures that will allow them to do so are under their governance. 

## Processes

There are two key processes relating to the contributors. First is becoming a member of specific role and the second is removal from such role. 

### Accepting into role

The acceptance to committer and administrator roles is done via voting process. Voting process can be specified by a squad in governance.md document if there is a change compared to the one presented here. 

The default requires to vote either via a public channel on Slack, where all squad committers have access or as a part of captured squad meeting that is publicly accessible. A simple majority is required for the vote to succeed.

### Removing from role

What should the Squad do when someone becomes inactive?

Example reasons for inactivity:

- Changes in life removing the possibility for the person to continue in the current role
- Changing company to another in which the person won't have the possibility to contribute
- Changing project within a company to another where the person won't be able to contribute
- Any other reason for stopping the contribution

We expect the person in any of the situations that will limit their ability to contribute in the roles Committer and Administrator to let the members of the squad know either via the Slack channel or on the next squad meeting that such a situation is arising.

The TSC will prepare general expectations towards the roles, and the squads will adapt and complete the template provided by TSC with the specific squad-related requirements.

In case any person stops fulfilling the roles of the specific role without any reason such as mid-term illness, it is the right and requirement on the squad to remove the person from such position. The removal happens automatically without a vote, and the squad is just acknowledging the situation. In case there is a conflict about the situation it is possible to escalate the matter to the TSC.
