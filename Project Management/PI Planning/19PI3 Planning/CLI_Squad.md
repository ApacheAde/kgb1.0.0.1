# CLI Squad - 19PI3 Objectives (June to August, 2019)
## Zowe CLI: 
* [BV10] Facilitate faster ZOWE CLI on-boarding by enhancing the interactive user experience. Introduce Zowe CLI WEB-HELP (which includes "HELP" for installed plugins) for easier navigation and in-context linking.
* [BV10] To promote ZOWE CLI and facilitate easier customer adoption, organize a list of popular CLI use cases and link to relevant sample scripts (templates) that can be easily consumed.
* [BV 7] To help drive Zowe adoption, introduce a stable version (1.0) of the Zowe VSCode Extension
* [BV 7] To help with OM APIML microservice SDK development and further extend USS files capabilities, add CREATE and MOUNT FILE SYSTEM functionality to Zowe CLI files group.
## Zowe CLI: Technical Currency 
* Confirm ZOWE CLI and all ZOWE CLI GA plugins are compatible with current versions of underlying technologies (specifically LTS NODE.JS 12 and z/OS 2.4) to ensure the CLI continues to work without error when customers upgrade to the latest releases.
* For all contributions to Zowe CLI, Code coverage reports are generated and code coverage thresholds are defined and enforced through GitHub pull requests.
