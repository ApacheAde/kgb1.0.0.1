# Zowe Event Management Workgroup - 23PI3 - (2023/07/25 - 2023/10/23)

### Quick Background

- This workgroup was convened to investigate event management / event streaming technologies which satisfy use cases requiring push based notifications of platform events in real time, typically to off-platform technologies (Jenkins, Chat, Service Desk, etc.).
- Many existing products and vendors already have similar capabilities embedded within their deliverables, but they're rarely the same technology.
- We would like Zowe to set forward a standardized solution for surfacing and communicating Z events with off-platform technologies which can be used both by Zowe and by interested vendors / extenders. 

### Deliverables

- We currently envision a deliverable focused around 3 components:
  * Central Broker (Server-side hub)
  * Producer Library ( Zowe Wrapped OSS Library )
  * Consumer Library ( Zowe Wrapped OSS Library )
