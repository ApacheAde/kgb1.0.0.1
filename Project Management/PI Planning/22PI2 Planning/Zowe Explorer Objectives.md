# Zowe Explorer Squad - 22PI2 Objectives

## Respond to feedback from the community as V2 LTS is adopted
As Zowe V2 LTS is adopted, we are actively responding to incoming questions on Slack as users transition. In addition to installation, we are helping the community adopt best practices such as team configuration.

## Assist extenders meet V2 LTS conformance standards
As extenders seek V2 LTS conformance, we are actively responding to incoming questions on Slack to ensure our broader suite of extensions work very well together.
