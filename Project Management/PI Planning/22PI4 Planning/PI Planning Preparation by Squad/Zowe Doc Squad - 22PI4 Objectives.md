# Zowe Doc Squad - 22PI4 - (2022/10/25 - 2023/01/23)

## Documentation enhancements

Goal: Improve the documentation to onboard users more efficiently

Work items: 

- Review and refactor the documentation to clarify usuage content versus extend content
  - Oragnize the content correctly per category. For example, move the current "Installing server component" topic from Extend to Use
  - Clarify confusing concepts like "component". For example, "Installing Zowe z/OS core components" and "Installing extended z/OS components" 
- Components related
  - [Stretch] Zowe CLI: Complete part 2 of the installation checklist for V2 - an article named "Day One Checklist". This list will include a list of tasks that users can/should complete after Zowe CLI is installed and deployed.Â 
  - [Stretch] Zowe CLI: Recreate install CLI @next only if a CLI @next package is available
