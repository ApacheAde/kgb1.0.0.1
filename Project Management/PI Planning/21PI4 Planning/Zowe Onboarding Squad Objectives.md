# Zowe Onboarding Squad - 21PI4 Objectives (October 2021 to January 2022)


(1) Goal:  Drive Continuous Community Outreach
- Solicit Zowe Speakers / Generate Awareness of Upcoming Conference / Coordinate Submissions with OMP
- Close, review, summarize, file the Semi-Annual Zowe Survey (October) 
- Prep / Advertise / Deliver: OMP Zowe Quarterly Webinar: Focus Topic Survey Results & V2 Open Forum (Jan)

(2) Goal:  Prepare V2 Conformance Program & Facilitate Transition of all V1 programs to V2
- Drive collection of final V2 Conformance Candidates (from all squads) / incorporate all Ci-CD squad packaging requirements
- Evaluate, Prepare and *draft* the PLAN for V2 conformance transition & extender communication (align publication with V2 GA)
- PLAN and EXECUTE ON Extender notifications for V2 Conformance Requirements
- Revise the Conformance Application process
- - interactive vs. printing form
- - individual forms, vs. 1 long form
- - file "completed" forms at the community
- Support TSC in V2 planning

(3) Goal:  Nurture Community Growth
- Colloborate with with TSC to define Incubator projects Lifecycle (characteristics the contribution should have in order to be considered for Zowe, things to avoid, WIP limits i.e. # per year, life-cycle / length of incubation etc.)  [Note:  Most of this work will be on TSC]


(4) Goal: Transition the Onboarding Backlog To Zenhub [stretch]


Risks:
The Onboarding Squad is still small, we need more members to feel confident about achieving our goals!  Any volunteers?
 

Dependencies:
(1) API, CLI, Explorer, Web UI Squads for V2 Conformance Requirements + possibly more (Meet with extenders etc.)
(2) OMP:  Finalizing V2 Conformance program (Badges, Landscape, etc.)
