### 3. Other doc enhancements

- Glossary of terms that are linked to in doc so that people can understand the meaning of certain doc points 
- Task sheets in-doc to reduce need to read paragraphs before taking action
- More error codes for ZSS, app-server and desktop
- Add documentation for new plug-ins and incubator projects (ZEBRA, VSCode CICS extension, etc.)


### 4. Consolidate Zowe API documentation [#1645](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1645)

- Work with squads to consolidate all Zowe API doc information (location, format, and so on) 
- Check against the published Swagger API doc to identify the ones that are only hosted in GitHub repos. Research the possibility of adding those APIs in the same manner. 
- Provide an easy to find entry point on the doc site to access all Zowe API docs
