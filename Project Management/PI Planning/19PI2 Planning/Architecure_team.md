# Architecture Squad - 19PI2 Objectives (March to May, 2019)

## Focus on better Zowe installation and supportability

* Define a plan to achieve how Zowe instances can be easily updated
* Define how new applications from different providers can be delivered to existing Zowe instance (installed by any provider) and coexist in that instance (Zowe coexistence strategy / approach)
* Work with Zowe architects to define how to improve:
    * Installation/upgradability
    * Updatability
    * Logging/tracing (consistent logging format, a common place for logs)
    * Improve deployment/runtime model

## Contribute Java REST API SDK and Sample to enable onboarding of mainframe APIs
* Contribute the sample to the Zowe repository to make the creation of Zowe conformant services easier and get help from the community

# Dependencies
* Security service client that is done by API squad
