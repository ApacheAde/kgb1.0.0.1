# Zowe API ML & Security Squad - 21PI2 Objectives (May 2021 to July 2021)


## High-availability support implementation
(in support of RESILIENCE theme)

* [API ML Squad Issue: Support for high availability / sysplex distributor in API Mediation Layer #705](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/705)  
Complete Caching API including implementing another persistent solution beyond VSAM and validate high availability for the API ML.

API ML Squad Plan:  
 

## Improve testing for the API Mediation Layer both on & off platform  
(in support of SECURITY theme)  


* [Improve testing for the API Mediation Layer both on & off platform #1341](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1341)  
Increase confidence in the API ML by improving: build stability, developer experience, reliability of codebase  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Enhance Integration test suite #1313](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1313)  
[Enhance our higher order test suites #1332](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1332)  
[Tests for platform dependent code #1333](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1333)  
[Flaky test ApiCatalogEndpointIntegrationTest #1342](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1342)  
[move e2e tests on stable environment #1187](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1187)  


## Implement and Release AT-TLS aware Zowe API ML
(in support of SECURITY theme)

* [API ML AT-TLS aware implementation #1345](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1345)  
Our objective is to integrate with the z/OS native AT-TLS component to better fulfill TLS security requirements coming from users. Following the research undertaken in 21PI1, this objective will see the implementation and release.  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Possibility to switch between AT-TLS and application TLS #1346](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1346)  
[AT_TLS aware Gateway #1347](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1347)  
[AT-TLS aware Discovery service #1348](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1348)  
[AT-TLS aware caching service #1349](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1349)   

Risk:  
We need to verify that the Marist environment can support AT-TLS tests. We will need support from Marist admins to do this. We know that this can be time-consuming and so this Issue could take multiple iterations to complete. This risk is mitigated from a paralell effort to test on internal environments.

## Zowe API ML PW Change

* [Metrics Dashboard for ML Services #820](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/820)  
Allow Tyler, the Zowe API ML administator, to track the health and performance of the API ML.
An initial Metrics Service to include basic monitoring information, relying heavily on pre-configuration given by Netflix Hystrix and Turbine.

API ML Squad Plan:  
 

## Zowe / api-layer backlog management

* [Focus on priority / high impact issues in Github](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/labels/21PI2)
