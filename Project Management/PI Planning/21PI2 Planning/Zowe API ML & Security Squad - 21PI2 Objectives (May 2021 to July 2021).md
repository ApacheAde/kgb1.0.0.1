# Zowe API ML & Security Squad - 21PI2 Objectives (May 2021 to July 2021)


## High-availability support implementation
(in support of RESILIENCE theme)

* [API ML Squad Issue: Support for high availability / sysplex distributor in API Mediation Layer #705](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/705)  
Complete Caching API including implementing another persistent solution beyond VSAM and validate high availability for the API ML.

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Discovery service configuration key inconsistency #1358](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1358)  
[Spike: Deploy API ML in HA setup in external environment #1360](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1360)  
[Integrate the HA setup in our Integration Testing procedure #1361](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1361)  
[Properly handle redis reconnect error #1363](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1363)  


## Improve testing for the API Mediation Layer both on & off platform  
(in support of SECURITY theme)  


* [Improve testing for the API Mediation Layer both on & off platform #1341](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1341)  
Increase confidence in the API ML by improving: build stability, developer experience, reliability of codebase  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Enhance Integration test suite #1313](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1313)  
[Enhance our higher order test suites #1332](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1332)  
[Tests for platform dependent code #1333](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1333)  
[Flaky test ApiCatalogEndpointIntegrationTest #1342](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1342)  
[move e2e tests on stable environment #1187](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1187)  


## Implement and Release AT-TLS aware Zowe API ML
(in support of SECURITY theme)

* [API ML AT-TLS aware implementation #1345](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1345)  
Our objective is to integrate with the z/OS native AT-TLS component to better fulfill TLS security requirements coming from users. Following the research undertaken in 21PI1, this objective will see the implementation and release.  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Possibility to switch between AT-TLS and application TLS #1346](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1346)  
[AT_TLS aware Gateway #1347](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1347)  
[AT-TLS aware Discovery service #1348](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1348)  
[AT-TLS aware caching service #1349](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1349)   

Risk:  
We need to verify that the Marist environment can support AT-TLS tests. We will need support from Marist admins to do this. We know that this can be time-consuming and so this Issue could take multiple iterations to complete. This risk is mitigated from a paralell effort to test on internal environments.

## Metrics for Zowe API MLÂ 

* [Metrics Dashboard for ML Services #820](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/820)  
Onboard intern(s) so they can get started building the Metrics service in 21PI3.  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Create Metrics Service #1098](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1098)  

## Support Mainframe Password change  

* [Support Mainframe Password change #1377](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1377)  
Facilitation and support for mainframe password changes originating from clients. Password change facility that can scale regardless of the security provider in place (z/OSMF, SAF Direct, etc).  

API ML Squad Plan:  
[Add possibility to change passwords via SAF #815](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/815)  

## Sticky sessions for Zowe API ML services 

Route user requests such that future requests from that user are routed to the same service instance as the original request.

## Zowe API ML to adopt and surface ESM's consolidated SAF Identity tokens 

* [Zowe API ML to adopt and surface ESM's consolidated SAF Identity tokens #1390](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1390)  
Tyler / Zach is now enabled to open access to Zowe Conformant APIs via Zowe API ML using SAF Identity JWTs that are issued, validated, and managed directly by z/OS (ESM SAF).

## Zowe / api-layer backlog management

* [Focus on priority / high impact issues in Github](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/labels/21PI2)
