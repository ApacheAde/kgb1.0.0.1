# Zowe Doc Squad - 23PI2 (2023/05/02 - 2023/07/24)

## Improve the documentation based on user feedback

Work items: 

- Enrich the documentation to accelerate user's time to value:

  - Improve user education on keystores & certificates, and how Zowe uses them ([#1880](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/1880)). (Add a high-level Using Certificates and key concepts sections, and demo videos)

    - Incorporate feedback from OOBE study of installing z/OS components

    - Improve the High Availability documentation ([#2545](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/2545), [#2563](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/2563))

    - DE: Address certificate management tooling references from v1 that have been deprecated [#2823](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2823).
    
    - Simplify AT-TLS setup ([1879](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/1879))

  - Finalize the Installation Roadmap for v2 (with links to certificate enhancement sections)

  - Incorporate Contribute resources that are currently only available in GitHub repos for better visibility (#[2650](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/2605))
 
  - Make sure internal and external documentation for Zowe Explorer meets the CII Badge standard ([#1966](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1966))

  - (Stretch) Start development of onboarding stories told from a persona's point of view with links to applicable articles. ([#2836](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/2836))

  - (Stretch) Provide learning resources about open source and Linux  

     “There's an expectation of familiarity with open source and Linux”  - *Zowe user*
