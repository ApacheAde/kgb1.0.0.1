# Zowe API ML Squad - 23PI2 Objectives (May 2023 to July 2023)

## {CONTINUED} Identity Federation #2481

As a Mainframe user, I want to be able to be correctly routed to the relevant sysplex based on the type of request and also get the information about the existing and available Sysplexes. I also want to be able to synchronize users between distributed Identity providers and ESMs.

Plan:
- [Identity Federation #2481](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2481)
- [Multi-tenancy APIML Deployments #2651](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2651)


## {CONTINUED} SMF Records creation #2533

If the user is being authenticated against SAF or zOSMF such an attempt is being recorded as the SMF record. This serves for auditing purposes. There are situations when API ML is validating user authentication by API ML issued JWT. This information is currently not recorded in SMF.

As a system administrator, I would like to know about every authentication attempt and I would like to see it in a single place. API ML needs to create SMF record for each authentication with API ML JWT or PAT with details such as timestamp, mainframe identity, and form of the provided authentication(JWT, PAT,...).

- [Issue the SMF record when invalid token is provided, turned on by default #2765](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2765)
- [Issue the SMF record when valid token is provided, turned off by default #2764](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2764)
- [Issue the SMF record when Zowe token is created while mapping certificates #2763](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2763)

## z/OS V3R1 (3.1) Toleration Support for the API ML on TSS and ACF2 #2881

As a system administrator I want to be able to run the API ML on z/OS 3.1 with the confidence that it will continue to function as expected.    
- Regression Test the API ML on the forthcoming z/OS V3R1Â operating system to verify it continues to function properly.  

**API ML Squad Plan:**  
- [z/OS V3R1 (3.1) Toleration Support for the API ML on TSS and ACF2 #2881](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2881)

## API Catalog UI enhancements and templating #2586

As a system administrator I want to be able to run the API Catalog properly off-platform in a distributed environment such as cloud platform and I want to be able to use our company branding on the portal so it's usage feels natural for the engineers within the company.    
- API Catalog supports templating so that it can be branded and themed according to user preferences  

As a system programmer or application developer, I want to have one easy place to see all the APIs available within the company with great examples of how to use them. 
- API Catalog contains UI enhancements

**API ML Squad Plan:**

- [API Developer Portal #2586](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2586)

## Supportability of Zowe #1796

Zowe will enhance the support experience of Zowe with the aim to reduce the number of support cases opened. Where cases are opened this objective will reduce time taken to identify defects' root causes and more quickly address configuration problems.

**Problems to solve:**

- With current tooling, it's difficult for Zowe users to understand what's wrong and resolve the problem themselves without needing external help
- For L1 support it's difficult to retrieve the information about the system from the user

**API ML Squad plan:**  

- [Report API ML state to the MF System Programmer #1633](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1633)

- [More details on Keystore and Truststore generations from external CA CERT is needed](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1440)

**Bug Fixes**

- [Gateway landing page not reflecting the correct Authentication service state](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1562)
- [Zowe log may contain ZWEAD400E error message even when everything works as expected](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2836)
- [Enhance messages in case of authentication failure with z/OSMF](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2748)

## {Stretch} Better Observability of onboarded services via Open Telemetry

We want to explore the option of introducing the Open Telemetry into the Zowe API Mediation Layer. As a part of the overall
Observability approach we are also considering to deprecate and then archive the metrics service.

## Zowe / api-layer backlog management

- [Zowe log may contain ZWEAD400E error message even when everything works as expected #2836](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2836)
